run the driver
<ode_order_1_by_z_main.m>

input: 
all parameters are stored in the file 
	<fourier_normalizer_const.m>

output:
ode_order_1_by_z_main_init_rk_max_fun_1000.xlsx

to get the plot figures, set flag_plot = true in <fourier_normalizer_const.m>

remark:

the code is not optimized to the best performance. the performance can be improved by enhancing the optimization process
