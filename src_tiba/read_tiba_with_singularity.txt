this is run instruction to generate the results for the following paper

"Trigonometric Interpolation Based Based Approach for Second Order ODE with
Mixed Boundary Conditions"


To generate results in Table II, III, IV, Figure 1 in section 6.1,  

1) run "main_tiba_with_w()" with following setting 

    flag_save_excel = true;
    flag_save_fig = false;
    smooth_PQR = true; %default
    cond_types = {'Neumann','Dirichlet', 'mix_1', 'mix_2'}; %default
    qs = [6,7,8]; %in paper 
    degs = [2]; % in paper 
    deg_ws = [0, 1, 2]; % in paper 
    paras =[0.5, 1, 2, 4]; %in paper
    sts = [e];  %%in the paper, 
output file:  main_tiba_with_w_smooth_PQR_1.xlsx

2) set 
	smooth_PQR = false;  
and run "main_tiba_with_w()" again. 
output file:  main_tiba_with_w_smooth_PQR_0.xlsx


note:  cond_type 1,2,3,4 are associated to 'Neumann','Dirichlet', 'mix_1', 'mix_2' respectively


3) to get the results with "trin" in Table II
	
output will be written to the file 

To generate results in Table V and Figure 2,  
run  main_tiba_singular() with following setting:

    flag_save_excel = true;
    flag_save_fig = true;
    smooth_PQR = true;
    cond_types = {'Neumann','Dirichlet'}; % in the paper
    qs = [6,7,8]; %default 
    paras = [1,2,3]; %default 
    st = e;

note:  cond_type 1,2 are associated to 'Neumann','Dirichlet' respectively
